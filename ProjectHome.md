A color picker is something that has always been missing from the standard set of components which developers can build their user interface in Android with. Although there have been a few color pickers floating around on the internet I never found any that I thought was good enough for use in my applications so I sat down to write my own. This is the result and I have decided to release it as open source application for all you developers out there to use, free of charge of course.

Android 1.6 or newer is required to use this library.

## How to Use ##
This color picker library can be used as a library project, please checkout the code and the demo app for information on how to use it.

There are basicly three different ways to use this color picker. You can add it to your preference using the ColorPickerPreference class. You can also use it as a dialog using the ColorPickerDialog class. Or you can simply use the ColorPickerView to add the color picker anywhere you want in you application. All three cases are demonstrated in the demo app, please refer to the demo for information on how to use it.



### Please Note ###
If you were using an older version of this project you were required to disable hardware acceleration to make it work on newer versions of Android. This is no longer required and should **not** be done!
